### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    I received a lot of satisfaction from my engagement in Lab 2, where I acquired insights on the intricacies of the Linux terminal. Although the learning curve proved to be challenging, the opportunity to put my newfound skills into practice in a lab setting dedicated to formatting and navigation was profoundly enlightening. As a result, I have been able to apply this knowledge effectively in subsequent lab exercises, leading to greater levels of success.

* Lab 5

    I really enjoyed participating in Lab 3. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that taught me a lot about sorting algorithms and their applications. I learned how to implement various sorting algorithms, including insertion sort and merge sort, and gained a better understanding of their time complexity and efficiency. Overall, it was a great opportunity to delve deeper into computer science principles and apply them to practical programming problems.

* Lab 9 
    I loved how it allowed me to practice working with text files, parsing data, and filtering out specific data based on a set of criteria. I also appreciated how the assignment provided clear instructions and functions to help me build the program. Through completing the assignment, I learned more about the C++ programming language, specifically how to use vectors and strings to manipulate and store data. I also gained a deeper understanding of file input/output and the importance of error handling in programming.
